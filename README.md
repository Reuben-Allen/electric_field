# Electric Field Visualization

This program will generate a stream plot representing the
electric field surrounding static particles. To get started,
simply run the program and follow the prompts to enter information.

###### Example:

```
Enter the number of charged particules you wish to simulate:
2
Enter the coordinates and charge of particle 1 using the format 'x,y,q':
-5,5,-1
Enter the coordinates and charge of particle 2 using the format 'x,y,q':
5,-5,1
```
